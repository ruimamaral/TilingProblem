# TilingProblem

First project for the 22/23 Algorithm Analysis and Synthesis class in IST.

Students were tasked with finding an algorithm that would calculate the amount of different ways an area could be filled with square tiles.

An area would be defined by two integers which represent the length and width of a rectangle followed by multiple integers, each being the length of each row.
However there is one restriction, if the column of index `i` has length `n`, then the length of the column of index `n + 1` should be `>= i`.
